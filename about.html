    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    <img src="assets/founder-placeholder.jpg" alt="Founder Photo" />
    <p><strong>College is one of the biggest investments your family will ever make.</strong> At Rise & Launch Prep, our mission is to help students not just get into college â€” but get into the *right* one. One that matches their goals, empowers their story, and sets them up for long-term success.</p>
    <p>We created Rise & Launch to bring high-impact, human-centered college consulting to families who want results without stress. We work one-on-one with students to uncover their potential, package their accomplishments, and deliver a compelling application that truly reflects who they are.</p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <img src="assets/strategy-placeholder.jpg" alt="Strategy Visual" />
    <p>We believe in starting early. Thatâ€™s why we work with students in grades <strong>9â€“12</strong>, guiding them through every step: from course selection and extracurricular development to summer planning and passion project design. By building a smart, strategic academic path early, students are better equipped to stand out when application season arrives.</p>
    <p>We donâ€™t do cookie-cutter checklists. We help your student build *their* narrative â€” and ensure every part of their profile supports it.</p>

    <h2>Essay-Driven Admissions Coaching</h2>
    <img src="assets/essay-placeholder.jpg" alt="Essay Support Image" />
    <p>College essays are more than writing exercises â€” theyâ€™re opportunities for self-reflection and storytelling. We guide students through our unique essay framework to help them find their voice, craft compelling personal statements, and write thoughtful supplements that show colleges exactly why they belong on campus.</p>
    <p>Our students leave this process not just with stronger essays â€” but with deeper confidence in their own voice and story.</p>

    <h2>Where We Started</h2>
    <img src="assets/origin-placeholder.jpg" alt="Our Origin Story" />
    <p>Rise & Launch Prep was co-founded by R & L â€” two student mentors, leaders, and creators who saw how overwhelming and impersonal the college process could be. Drawing on our experiences in student government, writing, tech, and education, we created a new kind of advising company: one rooted in empathy, storytelling, and long-term growth.</p>
    <p>We know how to navigate the Northern Virginia school system, we've been through it!</p>

    <h2>Get Started</h2>
    <img src="assets/consult-placeholder.jpg" alt="Free Consult Visual" />
    <p>We offer a <strong>free initial consultation</strong> for all new families. Whether you're a freshman planning ahead or a senior racing toward deadlines, weâ€™re here to help you find clarity â€” and take action. After our first meeting, weâ€™ll build a custom timeline and support plan just for your student.</p>

    <p><strong>College is a launchpad. Letâ€™s make sure you rise.</strong></p>
