  <h1>What to Do in 9th & 10th Grade to Stand Out Later</h1>

  <p>Most students don’t start thinking seriously about college until junior year — but by then, they’ve missed some of the best windows to build a standout story. The earlier you start, the more flexibility, clarity, and confidence you’ll have.</p>

  <p>Here’s what we recommend for students in 9th and 10th grade to lay a strong foundation for college success (without stressing out or overloading):</p>

  <h2>1. Build a Strong Academic Base</h2>
  <p>Colleges care a lot about your transcript. That doesn’t mean you need to take every AP possible — but it does mean your course selection should show growth, curiosity, and readiness to challenge yourself over time. Focus on consistency and upward trends.</p>

  <h2>2. Explore, Then Focus Your Activities</h2>
  <p>It’s okay to try different clubs or sports freshman year — but by 10th grade, start focusing on 2–3 things you really enjoy. Go deeper, not wider. Leadership, initiative, or long-term involvement in one area can matter more than doing “everything.”</p>

  <h2>3. Start a Passion Project</h2>
  <p>Is there something you care about that isn’t already on your school’s radar? Start a blog, organize a local event, build a website, tutor peers, or launch a small fundraiser. Even small things can grow into big stories over time — and show colleges that you're self-driven and creative.</p>

  <h2>4. Build Relationships with Teachers</h2>
  <p>Teacher recommendations matter — and they come from the people you engage with consistently. Show up, participate, ask questions. You don’t need to be the loudest person in class to be memorable — you just need to be thoughtful and engaged.</p>

  <h2>5. Start Learning the Admissions Language</h2>
  <p>Terms like “Common App,” “test-optional,” “holistic review,” and “Early Decision” might not mean much yet — but starting to learn the vocabulary of admissions now will make junior/senior year feel way less scary.</p>

  <p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> Keep a brag sheet or personal journal of things you’re proud of — no matter how small. These details often get lost later when it’s time to fill out your activity list or brainstorm essay topics.</p>

  <p>We always say: start early, stay curious, and let your story evolve. If you’re not sure what direction to go in, that’s what we’re here for. Early high school is the perfect time to get aligned, explore, and plant the seeds that grow into a strong application later.</p>
