    <h1>5 Common College Essay Mistakes (And What to Do Instead)</h1>

    <p>We‚Äôve read a lot of essays. Some great, some unforgettable‚Ä¶ and some that made us want to gently scream into a pillow. Here are five of the most common mistakes we see ‚Äî and what you should do instead to make your essay shine.</p>

    <h2>1. Playing It Too Safe</h2>
    <p>Generic essays about leadership, service trips, or ‚Äúworking hard‚Äù rarely stand out. The best essays are specific, personal, and sometimes a little vulnerable. Don‚Äôt be afraid to be real ‚Äî it‚Äôs your story that makes the difference, not the resume bullet points.</p>

    <h2>2. Writing Like a Resume</h2>
    <p>If your essay could double as your activities list, it‚Äôs not doing its job. The essay is your chance to show your voice and values ‚Äî not to rehash accomplishments. Focus on what moments meant to you, not just what you did.</p>

    <h2>3. Cramming In Too Much</h2>
    <p>You don‚Äôt need to cover your whole life in 650 words. Zoom in. A single day, conversation, or problem can reveal so much more than a timeline of everything you‚Äôve ever achieved.</p>

    <h2>4. Using ‚ÄúThesaurus Voice‚Äù</h2>
    <p>We get it. You want to sound impressive. But if your essay reads like it was written by a robot who majored in SAT words, admissions officers won‚Äôt connect with it. Write like yourself ‚Äî polished, but human.</p>

    <h2>5. Forgetting the ‚ÄúSo What?‚Äù</h2>
    <p>Reflection is everything. What did you learn? Why does it matter? How did it change you? Every story should lead to insight ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs small and quiet. That‚Äôs what schools are really reading for.</p>

    <p><strong>Bottom line?</strong> Be honest. Be intentional. Be clear. And remember: the best essays are the ones only you could write.</p>
