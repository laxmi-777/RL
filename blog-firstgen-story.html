  <h1>How We Navigated College Admissions as First-Gen Students</h1>

  <p>When we started our college application journeys, we were completely lost. As first-generation students growing up in Loudoun County, Virginia, we didn‚Äôt have a family roadmap for how to apply to college ‚Äî let alone how to write a compelling essay, build a school list, or win scholarships.</p>

  <p>We remember sitting through school assemblies where people tossed around words like FAFSA, ED1, or Common App, and feeling like we were already behind. We Googled our way through the process, asked the same questions again and again, and made mistakes we wished someone could‚Äôve helped us avoid.</p>

  <p>But here‚Äôs the truth: even without a blueprint, we figured it out ‚Äî and now we help others do the same. We earned over <strong>$100,000</strong> in scholarships, got into some of our top-choice schools, and most importantly, walked away from the process feeling confident, proud, and seen.</p>

  <p>Now, as founders of Rise & Launch Prep, we bring that same mindset to our students ‚Äî especially those who don‚Äôt have legacy support or college-savvy parents. We break the process into manageable, clear steps. We offer real feedback and real encouragement. And we make sure every student knows that their story matters, no matter where they start from.</p>

  <p><em>Being first-gen isn‚Äôt a disadvantage ‚Äî it‚Äôs a strength.</em> You‚Äôve learned how to figure things out. You‚Äôve made your own way. And colleges are starting to recognize just how powerful that can be. Our job is to help you translate that strength into an application that speaks clearly, authentically, and boldly.</p>

  <p>If this sounds like your experience ‚Äî or your child‚Äôs ‚Äî we‚Äôd love to connect. We offer free consultations, and we‚Äôre here to help you navigate this path with the clarity we wish we had years ago.</p>
